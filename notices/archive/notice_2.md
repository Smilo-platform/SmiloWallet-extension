The Smilo Browser Extension is beta software. 

When you log in to the Smilo Browser Extension, your current account's address is visible to every new site you visit. This can be used to look up your account balances of Smilo and other tokens.

For your privacy, for now, please sign out of the Smilo Browser Extension when you're done using a site.
